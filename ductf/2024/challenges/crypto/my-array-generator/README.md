## Description

The MAG cipher was a fast stream cipher algorithm submitted to the eSTREAM
project of the eCRYPT network. It was not selected for consideration in the
second phase, as further cryptanalysis revealed a number of vulnerabilities
including a distinguisher, partial-key recovery and in some variants a full
key recovery. This challenge implements a weaker version of the MAG cipher
with some security features removed.

Funnily enough, the wikipedia article got deleted just as I was writing this
challenge due to a lack of notability.
