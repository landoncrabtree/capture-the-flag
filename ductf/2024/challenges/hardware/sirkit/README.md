## Description

We intercepted some design files. Maybe you can make sense of them?

**Errata**: Due to an engineering oversight, the input switches were not correctly connected. The design engineer responsible has been condemned to the soldering mines, in order to fix the manufactured PCBs. Please assume that inputs to the circuit can be connected to either VCC or GND, representing 1 or 0 respectively.
