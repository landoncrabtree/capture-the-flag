# Forensics 101 - 100 pts

Sometimes in forensics, we run into files that have odd or unknown file extensions. In these cases, it's helpful to look at some of the file format signatures to figure out what they are. We use something called "magic bytes" which are the first few bytes of a file.

What is the ASCII representation of the magic bytes for a RAR archive?

If we look at the Wikipedia page for the list of file signatures; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures, we can find the signature for RAR archives.
