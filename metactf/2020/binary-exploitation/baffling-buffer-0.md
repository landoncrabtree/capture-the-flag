# Baffling Buffer 0 - 150pts
While hunting for vulnerabilities in client infrastructure, you discover a strange service located at host1.metaproblems.com 5150. You've uncovered the binary and source code code of the remote service, which looks somewhat unfinished. The code is written in a very exploitable manner. Can you find out how to make the program give you the flag?

When analyzing the `bb0.c` file, I noticed a char array, 'buf' is created, consisting of 48 bytes. The 'vuln()' function then uses 'gets' to write into the buffer. Thus, a simple buffer overflow attack can be done using 
```shell
python3 -c "print('a'*100)" | ncat host1.metaproblems.com 5150
```
