# ROT-26 - 150pts
We've applied some encoding to obfuscate our messages. There's no way you can figure out the original message now?! I applied the unbreakable ROT 26 algorithm:

g!0{]n`7*+0y~+1|(!y.+0yKM9
<hr>

The flag can be decoded from the ROT-26 string by simply using an online decoder such as Dcode.fr.
